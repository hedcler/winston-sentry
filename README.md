# winston-sentry
A simple winston transport that logs your errors to sentry.

This transport is for winston 2.x and uses the new `@sentry/node` SDK instead of Raven.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @synapsestudios/winston-sentry
```

## Usage

Follow the steps in [sentry's docs](https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/quickstart/?platform=node) to set up your node sdk. The transport doesn't set up the sentry SDK for you in case you want to make any of your own sentry calls outside of the context of winston.

Initialize the transport and tell winston about it like this:

```
const winston = require('winston');
const SentryTransport = require('@synapsestudios/winston-sentry');
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  /* sentry init values */
});


module.exports = new winston.Logger({
  transports: [
    /* ... your other transports */
    new SentryTransport({ Sentry }),
  ]
});
```

## Logging behavior

Whenever an error with level `fatal` or `error` are logged with your winston logger that error will also be logged to sentry.
